- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @greta-monacelli

I am currently a second-year PhD student at Dublin City University under the supervision of Prof. TomÃ¡s E. Ward (DCU) and Prof. Thomas B. Murphy (UCD). 
I hold a BSc and a MSc in Mathematics from the University of Milano-Bicocca. 
My doctoral work explores adaptive data collection methods for medical and behavioural research. 
In particular, I focus on balancing data quality and the burden placed on the participants during longitudinal experiments.
My research is supported by the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics.
